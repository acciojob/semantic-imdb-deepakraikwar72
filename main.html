<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
A gang of robbers on hi-tech motorbikes, led by the charismatic Kabir, is sweeping through Mumbai, outwitting the police at every turn. When officer Jai Dixit is assigned to catch the criminals, he reluctantly enlists the help of garage mechanic and bike enthusiast Ali. Though the pair do not see eye-to-eye at first, they soon become a formidable team, tracking their enemies from the streets of Mumbai to the beaches of Goa.
